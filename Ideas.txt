Chunk miner:

How chunk miner world work:
Have ~ 2 functions, the first function is standard chunk mining, but when it detects
a full inventory it'll execute the second function which sends it to the surface and makes
it deposite all of its items into a double chest, after it deposits its items it'll
start a function which sends it down a ~200 times and then positions the turtle
at the starting point of function 1. This loops




Remote turtle(+ EXPANDABILITY WITH ANNOYING SCRIPTING):

How it works:

A bunch of turtle functions that get triggered when it receives specific words
broadcasted over rednet so if it hears "GPS" it'll send back its exact
cords and if it hears "STRIP MINE" it'll begin optimally strip mining

turtle should have ~32 - ~64 chests to perform various advanced functions

I'd be able to write new functions for it by programming scripts which broadcast
a bunch of basic keywards to the turtle(Forward up down left right place break)
